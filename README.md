# Instacart Basket Analysis

# Project Overview
A demo project on Jupyter Notebook in order to clean data, join tables, analyze and create visualizations from publicly available data from Instacart. 

# Context
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Despite having a solid sales track record, they are keen to explore their sales patterns in greater detail and discover additional insights.

# Objectives
Perform an initial data exploration and analysis of selected Instacart datasets to gain insights and propose segmentation strategies based on specific criteria.

## Tasks include:
**Data Preparation**: Clean datasets, including order, product, department, and customer data.
**Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to answer questions from the marketing and sales teams. This includes identifying peak times of the day, the most profitable days of the week, popular product categories, and the most loyal customers.
**User Behavior Investigation**: Examine variations in users' ordering patterns based on different characteristics, such as region, income, and loyalty status.
**Customer Profiling**: Create customer profiles by combining various variables and examining potential differences in ordering behaviors, such as variations based on marital status and age groups.
