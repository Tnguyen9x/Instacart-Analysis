# Project Overview
A demo project on Jupyter Notebook in order to clean data, join tables, analyze and create visualizations from publicly available data from Instacart. 

# Context
Instacart is an online grocery store accessed through a mobile app. Although they have a strong sales track record, they are eager to delve deeper into their sales patterns and uncover more insights.

#Objectives
Perform an initial data exploration and analysis of selected Instacart datasets to gain insights and propose segmentation strategies based on specific criteria.

**Data Preparation**: Clean and merge four datasets, including order, product, department, and customer data.
**Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to answer questions from the marketing and sales teams. This includes identifying peak times of the day, the most profitable days of the week, popular product categories, and the most loyal customers.
**User Behavior Investigation**: Examine variations in users' ordering patterns based on different characteristics, such as region, gender, income, and loyalty status.
**Customer Profiling**: Develop customer profiles by combining various variables and exploring potential differences in ordering behaviors, such as those seen in married couples, singles, young adults, etc.
